## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Playwright browsers (`playwright install --with-deps chromium`)
- LinkedIn session cookies exported to `cookies.json`

### Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### Configuration

Copy the sample env file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Required environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key (GPT-4o-mini) |
| `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` | Perplexity AI API key (sonar-pro) |
| `FIRMABLE_API_KEY` | Firmable API key for company enrichment |
| `SERP_API_KEY` | SerpAPI key for Google Search |
| `SALESFORCE_USERNAME` | Salesforce login email |
| `SALESFORCE_PASSWORD` | Salesforce password |
| `SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN` | Salesforce security token |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username (email address) |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | SMTP password (app password for Gmail) |
| `SENDER_EMAIL` | Sender email (defaults to `SMTP_USER`) |

### Input

Add target companies to `data/input/companies.csv`:

```csv
company,location
Partmax,Melbourne
GRC Solutions,Sydney
```

## Usage

### Run the full pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Read companies from `data/input/companies.csv`
2. Retrieve company info (website URL, LinkedIn ID, industry)
3. Scrape news articles via Perplexity AI
4. Scrape LinkedIn posts via Playwright
5. Analyze posts with OpenAI, filter for growth signals, and generate a reachout message
6. Send a digest email to configured recipients

### Run individual components

```bash
# Summarize LinkedIn posts for a single company
python summarizer.py

# Send digest email from existing output data
python email_client.py recipient@example.com
```

## Output

Each company produces a JSON file in `data/output/` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "company": "Company Name",
  "articles": [
    {
      "headline": "...",
      "date": "DD/MM/YYYY",
      "summary": "...",
      "growth_type": "expansion",
      "source_url": "https://..."
    }
  ],
  "posts": [
    {
      "summary": "...",
      "growth_type": "new_hires",
      "date": "20/01/2026 - 5d"
    }
  ],
  "message": "AI-generated LinkedIn reachout message...",
  "linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/..."
}
```

## CI/CD

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/weekly-scrape.yml`) runs the pipeline on push to main or via manual dispatch. All API keys and credentials should be stored as GitHub Secrets.
