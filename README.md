## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Playwright browsers (only if using fallback scraper)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd armitage-automation

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers (optional, only for fallback)
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### Configuration

Copy the sample env file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Required environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key (GPT-4o-mini) for post analysis |
| `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` | Perplexity AI API key (sonar-pro) for news scraping |
| `FIRMABLE_API_KEY` | Firmable API key for company enrichment |
| `SERP_API_KEY` | SerpAPI key for Google Search |
| `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY` | **BrightData API key for LinkedIn scraping (primary method)** |
| `SALESFORCE_DOMAIN` | Salesforce instance URL (e.g., `https://yourorg.my.salesforce.com`) |
| `SALESFORCE_USERNAME` | Salesforce login email |
| `SALESFORCE_PASSWORD` | Salesforce password |
| `SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN` | Salesforce security token |
| `CONSUMER_KEY` | Salesforce Connected App consumer key (OAuth) |
| `CONSUMER_SECRET` | Salesforce Connected App consumer secret (OAuth) |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN` | Salesforce access token |
| `SMTP_USER` | SMTP username (email address) |

| `SENDER_EMAIL` | Sender email (defaults to `SMTP_USER`) |
| `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` | Email recipients (comma-separated) |
| `USE_PLAYWRIGHT_FALLBACK` | **Optional:** Enable Playwright browser fallback (default: `false`). Set to `true` for local testing. |

### Input

Add target companies to `data/input/companies.csv`:

```csv
company,location
OnQ Software,Melbourne
Axcelerate,Brisbane
GRC Solutions,Sydney
```

## Usage

### Local Execution

#### Run the full pipeline (API-only mode - Default)

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Read companies from `data/input/companies.csv`
2. Retrieve company info (website URL, LinkedIn ID, industry)
3. Scrape news articles via Perplexity AI
4. **Scrape LinkedIn posts via BrightData API only**
5. Analyze posts with OpenAI, filter for growth signals, and generate a reachout message
6. Send a digest email to configured recipients

#### Enable Playwright fallback (Local testing only)

```bash
# One-time command with fallback enabled
USE_PLAYWRIGHT_FALLBACK=true python main.py

# Or update .env file
# Set: USE_PLAYWRIGHT_FALLBACK=true
```

This enables browser automation as a fallback if the API fails. **Use only for local testing.**

#### Run individual components

```bash
# Scrape all companies
python scraper.py

# Test API scraper
python scrapers/linkedin_scraper_api.py

# Test Playwright scraper (fallback)
python scrapers/linkedin_scraper_playwright.py

# Summarize LinkedIn posts for a single company
python utils/summarizer.py

# Send digest email from existing output data
python utils/email_client.py recipient@example.com

# Generate monthly schedule and install crons
python schedule/scheduler.py generate

# Sync data to Salesforce
python salesforce.py
```

### GitHub Actions (Cloud Execution)

The project includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated execution:

#### Setup GitHub Actions

1. **Push code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Setup automation"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Add secrets** to your GitHub repository:
   - Go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add all environment variables from `.env` as repository secrets

3. **Workflows will run**:
   - **Scheduled**: Monthly on the 25th at 00:00 UTC (`.github/workflows/run-schedule.yml`)
   - **Manual**: Click "Run workflow" in Actions tab

#### Benefits of GitHub Actions

✅ No server required - runs on GitHub infrastructure
✅ Free tier: 2,000 minutes/month
✅ API-based scraping works perfectly (no browser overhead)
✅ Automatic artifact storage (30-day retention)
✅ Email notifications on failure

For detailed setup instructions, see [`.github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`](.github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md)

## Output

Each company produces a JSON file in `data/output/` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "company": "Company Name",
  "articles": [
    {
      "headline": "...",
      "date": "DD/MM/YYYY",
      "summary": "...",
      "growth_type": "expansion",
      "source_url": "https://..."
    }
  ],
  "posts": [
    {
      "summary": "...",
      "growth_type": "new_hires",
      "date": "06/02/2026 - 1d"
    }
  ],
  "message": "AI-generated LinkedIn reachout message...",
  "linkedin_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/company/...",
  "potential_actions": [
    "Schedule introductory call",
    "Research competitive landscape"
  ]
}
```

## LinkedIn Scraping Strategy

### Primary: BrightData API (`linkedin_scraper_api.py`)
- ✅ Fast and reliable
- ✅ No browser required
- ✅ Perfect for CI/CD environments
- ✅ Returns structured JSON data
- 📊 Scrapes last 30 days of posts

### Fallback: Playwright (`linkedin_scraper_playwright.py`)
- 🔄 Automatic fallback if API fails
- 🎭 Advanced anti-detection (randomized fingerprints)
- 🌐 Guest access (no login required)
- 📄 Returns CSV data (auto-converted to JSON by summarizer)

The system automatically tries the API first and falls back to Playwright only if needed.

## Scheduling

### Local Cron (Linux/Mac)

The scheduler generates a monthly scraping plan and installs per-session cron entries:

```bash
# Generate schedule + install crons
python schedule/scheduler.py generate

# Check current schedule status
python schedule/scheduler.py status

# Remove all armitage crons
python schedule/scheduler.py uninstall
```

Check logs:

```bash
tail -f cron.log
```

### GitHub Actions (Recommended)

Use GitHub Actions for cloud-based scheduling:
- Runs monthly on the 25th at 00:00 UTC
- No server maintenance
- Automatic notifications
- Version-controlled configuration
- Free tier available

See `.github/workflows/run-schedule.yml` for configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### OpenAI "insufficient_quota" Error

If you get quota errors but have credits:
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits
2. Check "Monthly budget" - it might be set too low (e.g., $0.01)
3. Increase to $5-10
4. Verify payment method is active

### BrightData API Not Working

- Check API key in `.env` is correct
- Verify you have credits in BrightData account
- System will automatically fall back to Playwright

### GitHub Actions Failing

- Ensure all secrets are set in repository settings
- Check workflow logs in Actions tab
- Verify API keys are valid and have credits
